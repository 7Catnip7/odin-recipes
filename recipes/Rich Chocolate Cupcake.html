    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>7 ounces dark chocolate</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to follow</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a muffin pan with paper or foil liners.</li>
        <li><strong>Step:</strong> Melt the butter and chocolate in the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
        <li><strong>Step:</strong>Blend the eggs and sugar with a mixer in a large bowl. Stir the cooled melted chocolate into the egg mixture. Add the vanilla extract and instant coffee. Sift in self-rising flour and stir until well combined. Fill muffin cups 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, about 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
